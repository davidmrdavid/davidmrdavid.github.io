### Hola!

I'm a software engineer working on programming models and abstractions for serverless applications at Microsoft. Academically speaking, I'm interested in exploring how the co-design of PLs and their tooling (editors, debuggers, synthesizers, documentation, etc.) can positively influence programmer
productivity and software correctness. I am also fascinated by the shared logical foundations of database and programming languages theory, so I enjoy reading up on work at that intersection. I completed a BS and MS from UC San Diego, where I was advised by Nadia Polikarpova and Arun Kumar; we did some science together.
