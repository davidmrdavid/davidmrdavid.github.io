## Euh, what is this again?
Queen Logit is primarily a collection of notes by David Justo. It could include anything from review notes on Machine Learning, Programming and anything else in the realm of software.

## Wouldn't a Google Doc just do the trick too?
Nah, I find that Google Docs just get lost on my Google Drive and, for me, that just makes
for an unreliable hub for my notes. 

Also, I've found that I learn best by teaching. I like to think that writing public posts forces me to organize my notes as if they were short-lessons. Lastly, I've always wanted to start a blog. I'm just killing two birds with one shot here.
